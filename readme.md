I wrote this when I'm working on some point cloud data.
This program is wrote for generating point cloud data of artificial scenes.

Usage:
Main parameters can be found on MainGenerator object in sample scene.

Set sampling frequency to 0 to work on manual mode, in which you need to scan by pressing Fire1 which is left mouse button by default. This is important when you want to get high resolution while the auto scan mode may take a lot of time.
